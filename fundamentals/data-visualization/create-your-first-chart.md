# üë®‚Äçüî¨ Create your first chart

## Let's dive deep into those tools

This guide will walk you through the simple steps to create your first chart. You can build your charts with the SQL language over the datasets available in **Agnostic**. This guide will walk you through the steps to harness the full potential of this powerful tool.

**Prerequisites:**&#x20;

Before we begin, please ensure that you are logged into your **Agnostic** account and have the right permissions to create charts within your project.
{% endhint %}

### Step 1: Create a chart resource

1. Once you're logged in, you'll land on the project page where you can manage and view project resources like Charts, GraphQL Endpoints, and Dashboards.
2. To create your first chart, locate the "Create" button on the page and click on it. A dropdown menu will appear ‚Äì select "Chart."
3. A modal will pop up, prompting you to name your chart. Provide a descriptive name for easy identification. For this example, we will use ¬´ USDC Transferred to Coinbase VS Binance ¬ª

Once you've clicked on the "Create" button. You'll be seamlessly redirected to the newly created chart, ready for customization and configuration.

### Step 2: Writing SQL Queries

1. In the Chart interface, you'll see a text editor where you can write SQL queries. Start by composing your query based on the dataset available in Agnostic. You can use standard SQL syntax, including SELECT statements, JOINs, GROUP BY, and more.
2. As you type, you'll benefit from autocomplete suggestions for SQL keywords, tables, and columns from the Agnostic dataset. This feature streamlines the query-writing process and helps prevent typos and errors.
3. After composing your query, execute it using the "Play" button. You'll instantly see the results displayed in a table format, resembling a classic database GUI.

### Step 3: Chart Configuration

1. To create a chart, you need to define how the SQL query results will be visualized. Displaying chart relies on aliases to designate the chart's axes:

<table><thead><tr><th width="207">Axis</th><th>Aliases</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>X-axis</strong></td><td>Use the <code>chart_x</code> alias to define your X values</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Y-axis</strong></td><td>Use the <code>chart_y</code> alias to define your Y values</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Z-axis</strong> <em>(Optional)</em></td><td><p>There are two ways to define the Z-axis</p><ul><li>By using the <code>chart_z</code></li><li>Or by using a label on the Y-axis values like so <code>chart_y_{LABEL}</code><br>Example: <code>chart_y_USDC</code> and <code>chart_y_DAI</code> </li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>

2. Configure your SQL query to generate results that match the axis aliases you've defined.
3. Then select your chart type by clicking on  <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/sliders-horizontal (1).png" alt="Configuration modal" data-size="original"> (Chart configuration) - select "Line"

#### A clickbait example üëÄ

Let's create a chart showing the number of USDC transferred to Coinbase vs. Binance by week from May 2021.

```sql
select
  'Coinbase' as chart_z,
  date_trunc('week', timestamp) as chart_x,
  sum(input_2_value_uint256) as chart_y
from 
  evm_events_ethereum_mainnet
where
  timestamp >= '2021-05-01' and
  address = '0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48' and -- USDC token Address
  signature = 'Transfer(address,address,uint256)' and 
  input_1_value_address in (
  	'0x71660c4005BA85c37ccec55d0C4493E66Fe775d3', -- Coinbase 1
