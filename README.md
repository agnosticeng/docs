## Overview

{% hint style="info" %}
Here are some quotes that define our goals and the philosophy of Agnostic
{% endhint %}

> Paradoxically, while most blockchains consist of publicly available, open lists of records, it is extremely complicated to extract _useful_ data from a blockchain \[...] [Agnostic ](https://agnostic.engineering/)is tackling the issue of blockchain data accessibility by providing a platform to help developers access decoded data in real time.

> â€” From [Blueyard](https://blueyard.medium.com/agnostic-aa864b5f9a10)

> Our journey through the complexities of EVM-compatible blockchain data access has been one of discovery, innovation, and growth. As we continue to develop Agnostic, we remain dedicated to empowering builders and analysts with the tools they need to unlock the full potential of the Web3 world. Together, we will shape the future of decentralized technology and create a more open, transparent, and secure digital ecosystem.
